I am interested in taking the DATA602 course because I want to learn the principles of data science in a structured way. My main goal is to understand the data science life cycle step by step. I want to start with how to clearly define and frame a business problem, then learn how to collect, clean, and manage messy real-world data. From there, I want to practice exploring and analyzing the data to find meaningful patterns, applying statistical and machine learning techniques, and finally translating the results into useful insights that can help in decision-making.
